# Mahjongg Tile Dealer

A simple web-based tool to simulate dealing a hand of American Mahjongg tiles.

## Features

*   Represents a full 152-tile American Mahjongg set.
*   Deals a random hand of 13 or 14 tiles.
*   Displays the number of tiles remaining in the deck after each deal.
*   Sorts the displayed hand by Suit/Rank or by Rank/Suit.
*   Provides a 'Reset Deck' button to start a new game with a full deck.
*   Deal buttons automatically disable when insufficient tiles remain for a deal.
*   Visual representation of tiles using HTML and CSS.

## How to Use

1.  Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2.  Click the "Deal 13 Tiles" or "Deal 14 Tiles" button to see a randomly dealt hand. The number of tiles remaining in the deck will update.
3.  Click the "Sort: Suit/Rank" or "Sort: Rank/Suit" buttons to reorder your hand.
4.  Click the "Reset Deck" button to clear the current hand and start with a fresh, full deck of 152 tiles.

## Future Ideas
*   Using images for higher-resolution tile graphics.
*   Implementing specific Mahjongg hand analysis (separate project branch).
